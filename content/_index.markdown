# Welcome to Grapefruit

## _notes for my past self_

**Gentle Grapefruit** is something that I've been telling myself that I would get to eventually for about 4 years. Very little work is done on styling (if that isn't obvious). Instead, most of my time was spent on creating references and guides that I would have enjoyed having while working as a new data scientist. You can also think of this as a log of relevant pieces of information that I have digested.

There will be more categories and tags that appear as I dive into more specifics, and not all of my work will be hosted here, but I am hoping it serves as a useful tool for someone out there.

Below is a list of unorganized posts to get you started. You can check out more in [Posts](/post/); or alternatively dive into topics in [Categories](/categories/) or [Tags](/tags/).
