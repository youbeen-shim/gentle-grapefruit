title: a brief introduction
---

It's always nerve-wrecking to try to write an introduction for myself. My name is Youbeen, I am an ex-quantitative modeler and now a data scientist whose true ambition is to make incremental progress every day. At work, I spent majority of my time implementing different models that are published, keeping up with recent ML/DL developments, evaluating model assumptions, and cleaning data pipelines. I also do product-related work like defining/maintaining core metrics, designing AB tests, and analyzing customer characteristics. But if I had to explain my job to someone who is not in the field, I would say that I am just a curious guy finding fun facts to share about things that are going on. 

I'm also an immigrant from the Korea and a recent citizen, and have spent majority of my life in the States trying to define my identify and a role in this foreign country that I now call home. Some days are better than others, and some days I let my propensity for procrastination take over. Thankfully, I am surrounded by good company and good weather here in California. Slow and steady, as my dad would say.

If I'm not working on my projects (which include this blog), I'm probably spending time reading (historical fictions are my jam), chatting up friends, watching movies, or chilling with my cat on my lap. 

I've created this website part as a log for the work that I've done, partially (hopefully) to guide someone else who wants to work with digging for insights from a random assortment of numbers (or pictures! or words! but we'll get to that later). I don't pretend to be an absolute authority on the things that I write about, but I take great care in trying to be objective and factual and I take pride in making things easier to conceptualize for others.
