<p>Let’s start with a question that sounds like it could be a start of a bad joke:</p>
<p>What are the similarities between analyzing student performance across different schools, tracking patient outcomes across hospitals, and measuring user engagement across different product features?</p>
<p><abbr title="there is (typically) some natural group or hierarchy in the data (sorry if you were looking forward to a joke)">Answer</abbr></p>
<div id="cost-of-missing-the-hierarchy" class="section level2">
<h2>Cost of Missing the Hierarchy</h2>
<p>Often, hierarchy is difficult to conceive. Back in 2022, I was working as a product data scientist at a fintech startup, spending a lot of time with both the core product team and the marketing team on client engagement. As a part of my work, I introduced and popularized a new customer segmentation that considered the clients’ short-term financial priority on top of typical metrics such as their demographics. It helped us predict customer churn much more consistently and helped the growth team design targeted strategies for customers.</p>
<p>However, a benefit that I at the time did <em>not</em> expect was a deeper insight into feature engagement.</p>
<p>A product manager came to me with what seemed like a straightforward A/B test. They were testing a new feature that was hoping to increase customer engagement, and the initial results looked very promising - a whooping 17% bump overall on our primary metric. When I applied the new customer segment, however, we saw that the effect varied dramatically across different user groups. Some segments showed a 30% improvement, while others, it actually decreased by 5%.</p>
<p>When we looked at the entirety of our customer base, we were ignoring the hierarchical structure in the data, and by doing so, we risked:</p>
<ul>
<li>underestimating uncertainty in our estimates</li>
<li>missing important group-level effects</li>
<li>making incorrect inferences about individual-level relationships, and</li>
<li>failing to account for correlation within groups</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="limitations-of-traditional-approaches" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations of Traditional Approaches</h2>
<p>In <abbr title="admittedly limited">my experience</abbr>, precursor to multilevel modeling is one of two approaches:</p>
<div id="fit-one-modeling-for-everything-ignoring-group-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>fit one modeling for everything, ignoring group structure</h3>
<p>This is the same mistake that I made when I first designed the A/B test for the new customer engagement feature. Of course, hindsight is 20/20 and this approach does have its advantages: we can use all the available data &amp; the interpretation is relatively straightforward. But as we have already seen in my example, this ignores systematic variation between groups which often leads to misleading conclusions. Furthermore, if the effect within groups is strong enough, it negates the validity of our models as it violates the independence assumptions that are core to regression modeling.</p>
</div>
<div id="fit-completely-separate-models-for-each-group" class="section level3">
<h3>fit completely separate models for each group</h3>
<p>Perhaps a little better. This approach has the strength of being able to capture group-specific effects fully, at least as much as the available data allows us to. However, it <abbr title="a waste of perfectly good data">ignores information shared across groups</abbr> and makes comparing across groups a challenge. It also necessitates that we collect a new pool of samples for each group, which increases the amount of data and processing power required.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="intuition" class="section level2">
<h2>Intuition</h2>
<p>We can think of <abbr title="also called hierarchical modeling or mixed-effects modeling">multilevel modeling</abbr> as a happy middle ground between the two flawed approaches. If the first approach is a <em>“complete pooling”</em> scenario where all segments are treated the same and the second approach is a <em>“no pooling”</em> scenario where each segment gets its own model, our goal is to perform a <strong><em>“partial pooling”</em></strong> where we can allow different groups to have their own variation while still learning from other groups.</p>
<p>For example, in a simple regression model (complete pooling), we might say “every additional year of experience increases salary by $5,000,” which assumes that the effect of experience is identical across all industries.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Salary_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot Experience_i + \varepsilon_i\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 5,000\)</span> for all observations.</p>
<p>A multilevel model can instead say “the effect of experience varies by industry, but industries in similar sectors tend to have similar patterns: each year in tech equates to an $8,000 increase in salary, but a $2,000 increase in retail.”</p>
<p>Level 1 (individual):
<span class="math display">\[Salary_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} \cdot Experience_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ij}\]</span></p>
<p>Level 2 (industry):
<span class="math display">\[\beta_{0j} = \gamma_{00} + u_{0j}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\beta_{1j} = \gamma_{10} + u_{1j}\]</span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{00}\)</span> is the overall average salary baseline</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{10}\)</span> is the average experience effect across all industries</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(u_{0j}\)</span> is the industry-specific deviation from the average baseline</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(u_{1j}\)</span> is the industry-specific deviation from the average experience effect
<ul>
<li>Note: <span class="math inline">\(u_{0j}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_{1j}\)</span> are assumed to come from a normal distribution with mean 0</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The combined model that incorporates both level then becomes:
<span class="math display">\[Salary_{ij} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10} \cdot Experience_{ij} + u_{0j} + u_{1j} \cdot Experience_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ij}\]</span></p>
<p>The real magic in multilevel modeling, however, is that it optimally combines information from different sources based on their reliability. For segments with lots of precise data, the segment-specific estimate dominates. For segments with sparse or noisy data, the model “borrows strength” from the overall pattern.</p>
<p>On a high level, we:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Estimate an overall average effect across all groups</li>
<li>Estimate how much groups typically vary from this average</li>
<li>Produce group-specific estimates, which are <strong>weighted combinations</strong> of
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Group’s own data</li>
<li>Overall average across groups</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Where the <strong>weight</strong> depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li><abbr title="larger groups rely more on their own data">Sample size within the group</abbr></li>
<li><abbr title="more consistent groups rely more on their own data">Within-group variance</abbr></li>
<li><abbr title="when groups are highly variable, individual group estimates rely more on their own data">Between-group variance</abbr></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="sanity-check-does-group-membership-actually-matter" class="section level2">
<h2>Sanity Check: Does group membership actually matter?</h2>
<p>Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) is used to quantify the proportion of total variance that is attributable to group membership. It can be defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ICC = \frac{\tau_{00}}{\tau_{00} + \sigma^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau_{00}\)</span> is the between-group variance, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is the within-group variance</li>
</ul>
<p>If ICC is close to 0, it implies that the group membership explains very little. When it is close to 1, it means that almost all of the variance occurs between groups. I typically see values between 0.05 and 0.3, which is <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8282204/">consistent with what is seen in social sciences</a>.</p>

<div id="simulating-multilevel-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Simulating Multilevel Data</h2>
<p>In order to see the effects of multilevel modeling, we can first simulate data that resembles my A/B test scenario. The code below is adopted from <a href="https://library.virginia.edu/data/articles/simulating-multilevel-data">this article</a>, which is written by the very talented members of StatLab from my alma mater.</p>
<p>If you do not care for simulation, just know that we are creating a dataset with:</p>
<ul>
<li>individual users (Level 1)</li>
<li>user segments (Level 2)</li>
<li>treatment indicator (whether or not a user received the new feature)</li>
<li>engagement outcome
<ul>
<li>which is a sum of: the overall effect, segment specific effect, effect of the treatment, and user level variance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>varying treatment effects across segments</li>
</ul>
<p>And that the data that we simulated does not violate critical assumptions for multilevel modeling, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Random effects distribution: the group-level effects follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean of zero and an estimated variance-covariance matrix</li>
<li><abbr title="observations within groups can however be correlated">Independence across groups</abbr></li>
<li>Residual normality: Both individual-level residuals &amp; group-level residuals are normally distributed, with homoscedasticity (constant variance)</li>
<li>Linearity: the relationships between predictors and outcomes are linear (after accounting for the multilevel structure)
Note: There are extensions of multilevel modeling that considers non-normal distributions, heteroskedasticity, and additional correlations, among other things.</li>
</ul>

<div id="quick-conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Quick Conclusion</h2>
<p>In our example, while the overall treatment effect was positive, the multilevel model reveals that the treatment had varying impact based on user segments. Like so, by accounting for multilevel structure in our data, we gain crucial insights that would be missed with simpler approaches.</p>
<p>Connecting the significance of our research to our product partners, this would mean reconsidering a blanket rollout and instead creating a targeted implementation strategy that considers the segments that we have created.</p>
<p>Multilevel modeling isn’t just a statistical technique. It’s a way of thinking about variation and heterogeneity in your data that can lead to more nuanced insights and better decision-making. If nothing else, remember this: average effects can hide important variation. When your data has a natural grouping structure, consider the multilevel approach to uncover the full story behind your numbers.</p>
