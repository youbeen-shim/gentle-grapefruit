<h2>“Coral Zone: 2-Hour Parking Only”</h2>
<p>It’s a lazy Saturday morning. Clouds are cloaking the sun, so the air still feels chilly in my lungs. I woke up late despite having an early night yesterday, and all I want to do is be wrapped in a warm blanket back home. I’m meeting a client in 20 minutes, and the meeting itself should take no longer than 90-minutes, so the 2-hour limit is no problem. But it does take me back to the time where I worked at downtown Palo Alto, making micro-optimizations to “take back” every precious minute I had.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-background" class="section level2">
<h2>the Background</h2>
<p>Let’s set up the problem. Standing on University Avenue in downtown Palo Alto, you’ll notice a strange sign. Well, maybe not so strange - it reads: “Coral Zone: 2-Hour Parking Only”.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>

<p>Moreover, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>four distant parking zones: Purple, Coral, Lime, and Blue.</li>
<li>a nominal <abbr title="we'll ignore that some spaces allow for 3-hour parking for simplicity">“2-hour”</abbr> limit</li>
<li>$65 ticket for violations</li>
<li>$15 day-pass avaialbe for purchase</li>
<li>$900 annual pass that allows unlimited parking</li>
<li>an 8-hour workday</li>

<h3>Lawful Good</h3>
<p>The traditional, straight-edge, solution is straightforward: arrive at 8am, move at 10am, again at noon, once more at 2pm, and leave at 4pm.</p>
<p>Assuming that you did not take off for lunch and that parking takes 15 minutes each time, you could fit in 8 hours of work and be able to leave by 5pm. But is this optimal? And, perhaps more importantly, is it necessary?</p>
</div>
<div id="chaotic-neutral" class="section level3">
<h3>Chaotic Neutral</h3>
<p>Setting aside our responsibilities as law-abiding, rule-following, upright citizens of the republic, I couldn’t help but notice something interesting about the enforcement mechanism. The “2-hour” limit is not actually measured using the <em>time when you parked</em>, but rather using the <em>time when a parking enforcer last observed your vehicle</em>.</p>
<p>The true constrain isn’t time itself, but rather the probability of being observed by an enforcement officer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-framework" class="section level2">
<h2>the Framework</h2>
<p>Let’s discuss what we don’t know. In our basic probability model, two key parameters are unknown:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>: The number of parking enforcers</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>: The patrol rate (which we can define as zones visited per hour)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, see that the probability of getting a ticket (what we really care about) isn’t just a function of time - it’s a function of being observed when we have gone beyond the time limit. This is where survival analysis becomes particularly useful.</p>
<p>For any given time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> beyond the 2-hour mark, we can model the survival function <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> as the probability of not receiving a ticket up to time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ S(t) = P(T &gt; t) \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the time until receiving a ticket.</p>
<p>We can also represent the instantaneous rate of receiving a ticket at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> given survival up to that point using the hazard function <span class="math inline">\(h(t)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{P(t \leq T &lt; t + \Delta t | T \geq t)}{\Delta t} \]</span></p>
<p>In our case, this hazard function is influenced by both <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ h(t) = E \cdot R \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot (1 - e^{-\lambda t}) \]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> represents the probability of an enforcer being in your specific zone</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\((1 - e^{-\lambda t})\)</span> models the increasing probability of being recognized as a violator as time passes</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a parameter that controls how quickly the probability of recognition increases</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># hazard rate
calculate_hazard &lt;- function(t, E, R, lambda = 0.5) {
  # E: number of Enforcement officers
  # R: patrol Rate (zones per hour)
  # lambda: recognition rate
  # 1/4: probability of being in specific zone
  return(E * R * (1/4) * (1 - exp(-lambda * t)))
}</code></pre>
<p>This gives us our cumulative risk function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ R(t) = 1 - \exp\left(-\int_0^t h(u)du\right) \]</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code># cumulative risk
calculate_risk &lt;- function(t, E, R, lambda = 0.5) {
  time_steps &lt;- seq(0, t, length.out = 100)
  dt &lt;- time_steps[2] - time_steps[1]
  
  cumulative_hazard &lt;- sum(calculate_hazard(time_steps, E, R, lambda)) * dt
  return(1 - exp(-cumulative_hazard))
  
  # NOTE: 
  # return(exp(-cumulative_hazard)) 
  # would instead return survival probability
}</code></pre>
<p>The expected cost <span class="math inline">\(C(t)\)</span> for any given overstay duration <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> can then be calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ C(t) = 65 \cdot R(t) \]</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code># expected cost
calculate_cost &lt;- function(t, E, R, lambda = 0.5, ticket_cost = 65) {
  return(ticket_cost * calculate_risk(t, E, R, lambda))
}</code></pre>

<p>The plot above visualizes what happens after you’ve already been parked for the initial 2-hour limit.</p>
<p>We’re looking at three different scenarios - <em>Low</em>, <em>Medium</em>, and <em>High</em> enforcement levels - each represented by a different colored line. Think of each line as showing how “<em>aggressive</em>” the ticketing becomes at any given moment. The steeper the line, the more rapidly your risk is increasing. Notice how all three lines start at zero (when you first exceed the limit) and curve upward, but at different rates.</p>
<p>The low enforcement (green line) shows that even after 4 full hours beyond the limit, the rate barely reaches 1.0. In contrast, high enforcement (blue line) shows that within the first hour of exceeding the limit, the risk shoots up to beyond 2.0 - an extremely aggressive ticketing environment.</p>
<p>While convenient, <em>hazard</em> is a difficult concept to digest. Thankfully, we also have the following plots:</p>

<p>One the left, survival probability plot shows your chances of “surviving” without a ticket over time. In the high enforcement scenario, within just one hour of exceeding the limit, your chances of remaining ticket-free have plummeted to about 30%. Low enforcement scenario shows a more generous 70% chance of avoiding a ticket at the same 1-hour mark.</p>
<p>Cumulative risk plot on the right essentially <abbr title="notice how they are mirror images of each other">flips</abbr> this perspective. Instead of showing your chances of avoiding a ticket, it shows your chances of getting one. At any given time point, the probabilities in these two plots add up to 100%. Notice how, for example, after 2 hours beyond the limit in the medium enforcement scenario (orange line), your survival probability is about 15%, while your cumulative risk is about 85%.</p>
<p>In terms of decision-making, one particularly interesting feature is how the curves flatten out in both plots after 2-3 hours. In our example, this is easy to explain - you only get 1 ticket a day. So even if the hazard rate for the high enforcement scenario at the 1-hour mark was above a 2, all it means is that the “flattening” of the curve occurred earlier and more dramatically.</p>
<p>Using this framework allows us to start analyzing the real risk profile of different strategies.</p>
<p>You could, for instance, look at the survival probability plot to find where it crosses 50% - that’s your coin flip moment.</p>
<p>Another way to use these plots would be to observe that, the first hour is generally the most critical decision point. That is when your risk is increasing most rapidly.</p>

<h2>Learning from Limited Data</h2>
<p>Having established our risk mode, we face a practical challenge: how do we estimate <em>‘number_of_enforcers’</em> and <em>‘patrol_rate’</em> using our day-to-day experiences?</p>
<p>While not perfect, each day we park provides two key pieces of information: the duration we exceeded the limit by and whether or not we received a ticket. This also mirrors our reality: each data point that we accumulate has a cost attached to it.</p>
<p>Our likelihood function for a single observation can be expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ L(X,Y|t,\text{ticket}) = \begin{cases}
R(t|X,Y) &amp; \text{if ticket received} \\
1-R(t|X,Y) &amp; \text{if no ticket received}
\end{cases} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R(t|X,Y)\)</span> is our risk function from earlier. For our prior distributions, we can use reasonable assumptions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_X) \]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ Y \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha_Y, \beta_Y) \]</span></p>
<p>The question becomes: how many observations do we need for reliable estimates?</p>

<p>TODO: visualize the simulation studies here
&lt;Through simulation studies, I’ve found that about 20-30 workdays of data provide reasonable convergence for decision-making purposes&gt;. Using the (probably monte carlo), it looks like about 20-30 workdays of data provide reasonable convergence for decision-making purposes.</p>

<h2>When “Good Enough” Is Actually Perfect</h2>
<p>I know- I know- it is a lot of commitment (read: cost) to collect that much data. Thankfully, we don’t need to know exactly how many enforcement officers are patrolling or their exact rate of coverage. What we really need to know is when the risk crosses certain thresholds that would change our behavior.</p>
<p>Let’s define three key thresholds:
<span class="math display">\[ C_1(t) = \text{cost of moving car once per day} \]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ C_2(t) = \text{cost of moving car twice per day} \]</span>

<p>This simplified decision framework dramatically reduces our required sample size. Instead of needing precise parameter estimates, we only need enough data to determine which regime we’re in. In practice, I’ve found this often requires only 8-10 days of observations.</p>

<h2>More things to consider</h2>
<p>While the theory is elegant, there are additional real-world considerations that would help further improve our model that I have not discussed.</p>
<div id="temporal-variations" class="section level3">
<h3>Temporal Variations</h3>
<p>Parking officers are only human, and enforcement patterns aren’t uniform throughout the day. If, for example, I notice that patrol frequency tends to peak during mid-morning and early afternoon hours, I can modify the risk function to account for this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ h(t,\text{TOD}) = XY \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot (1 - e^{-\lambda t}) \cdot \phi(\text{TOD}) \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\phi(\text{TOD})\)</span> is a time-of-day adjustment factor.</p>
</div>
<div id="spatial-correlations" class="section level3">
<h3>Spatial Correlations</h3>
<p>The four-zone system introduces spatial dependencies that can be leveraged. Imagine that you observed an enforcer in the Blue Zone while moving your car. The probability of immediate enforcement in the Purple Zone, furthest away from the Blue Zone, decreases significantly. This creates opportunities for strategic zone selection.</p>
</div>
<div id="reframing-cost-benefit" class="section level3">
<h3>Reframing Cost-Benefit</h3>
<p>The true cost of moving your car isn’t just the time that was spent walking. At minimum, it should also include the loss in productivity from the required context switching. Gloria Mark, the study lead for <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf">“The Cost of Interrupted Work”</a>, estimates an average of <em>23 minutes and 15 seconds</em> to get back to the task. When every minute of productivity matters, the cost-benefit framework should be modified to reflect this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="beyond-parking" class="section level2">
<h2>Beyond Parking</h2>
<p>Using the parking puzzle, we explored survival analysis and bayesian learning, but I believe that the true lessons come from broader principles in risk calculation and decision theory.</p>
<div id="the-value-of-imperfect-information" class="section level3">
<h3>The Value of Imperfect Information</h3>
<p>We often do not need perfect information to make significantly better decisions. Understanding the key decision boundaries is frequently more valuable than precise parameter estimation.</p>
</div>
<div id="dynamic-risk-assessment" class="section level3">
<h3>Dynamic Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>The risk isn’t static - it evolves based on both time and previous observations. This dynamic nature appears in many real-world problems, from financial trading to resource allocation.</p>
</div>
<div id="practical-bayesian-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Practical Bayesian Analysis</h3>
<p>Sometimes the most valuable application of Bayesian methods isn’t in getting precise parameter estimates, but in updating our decision boundaries based on accumulated evidence.</p>
<p>Risk analysis
Whether you’re managing parking tickets, optimizing business processes, or making investment decisions, the core principles remain the same: understand your risk function, identify key decision thresholds, and gather just enough data to make informed decisions.</p>
