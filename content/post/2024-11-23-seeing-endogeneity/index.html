<h2>Seeing is Believing</h2>
<p>Contrary to what I’ve just said, I do not think that you need to see to believe - it sure does help though.</p>
<p>In <abbr title="I hope to do less of multi-series work, since I do not think that it is very conducive to learning.">Part 1</abbr>, we looked at how endogeneity can undermine models; mostly in secret, too. Today, I want to dive into solutions, using simulation to understand the problem and instrumental variables to solve it. I’ll be using a generalization of my work tackling endogeneity in production credit risk models.</p>
<p>Remember the <abbr title="if you just now visiting us, i dont think you need to read the first part if you already know endogeneity is a problem you want to solve">credit risk model problem</abbr> that I designed for new hires? Interest rates seemed like a perfect predictor of credit risk. However, it was a trap as interest rates and default risk was endogenous. Today, let’s see exactly how this affects our models.</p>
</div>
<div id="simulating-endogeneity" class="section level2">
<h2>Simulating Endogeneity</h2>
<p>The credit risk assessment deals with a classic case of endogeneity of <strong>omitted variables</strong>, where an unmeasured variable influences both predictor and the target. Both the predictor, <em>interest_rate</em>, and the target, <em>default_prob</em>, are influenced by the unobserved <em>credit_worthiness</em>.</p>

<p>Note: If you are the diligent type that is taking note of all the code, you’ll notice that I am using <strong><em>credit_data_iv</em></strong> instead of <strong><em>credit_data</em></strong> for all of the modeling &amp; visualization code below. Pretend for now that those two objects are exactly the same thing. Why one is in place of the other will make more sense later in the post.</p>

<p>First, notice how <em>credit_worthiness</em> variable is structured. It follows a standard normal distribution, representing the true quality of each individual that we cannot directly measure in practice.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>credit_worthiness &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)</code></pre>
<p>Then, we explicitly design endogeneity into the relationship. Notice how the formula creates a <abbr title="the exponential term creates a more realistic pattern where interest rates have a floor but can increase substantially for risky borrowers.">nonlinear relationship</abbr> where better credit worthiness leads to lower interest rates, plus some random noise.</p>

<h2>Seeing Endogeneity</h2>
<p>With the data now generated, we have sufficient knowledge that the features have endogeneity. We can now combine typical exploratory data work combined with some tips from the previous post to gauge the impact of endogeneity. In the visualizations below, note how endogeneity manifests in the data.</p>
<div id="plot-of-coefficients" class="section level3">
<h3>Plot of Coefficients</h3>
<p>A naive model that ignores endogeneity and uses all of the available data at hand might look something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>naive_model &lt;- lm(default_prob ~ business_age + annual_revenue + current_debt + 
                                 interest_rate + credit_utilization + cash_flow_volatility,
                  data = credit_data_iv)</code></pre>
<p>Using the model above, I can generate a plot of its coefficients. This is typically done to <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/calculate-feature-importance-with-python">gauge each individual feature’s importance</a>, which is intuitive since <a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/interpret-coefficients-p-values-regression">coefficients show how much the target variable changes for a one-unit increase in the feature, assuming all other features remain constant</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see, if anything, machine learning algorithms are even more likely to identify <em>interest_rate</em> as a strong predictor (which is obvious, given its endogeneity) and overfit on it. This can lead to some disasterous misinterpretation and a lot of head scratching when your models underperform in live testing.</p>

<h3>Interest Rate vs Default Probability</h3>
<p>Observing the overwhelming power of <em>interest_rate</em>, you might be inclined to see it’s direct relationship with with our target, <em>default_prob</em>. Notice how the apparent relationship between the two variables (the red line) can mislead us. While the line shows almost a linear relationship, by incorporating <em>credit_worthiness</em>, we can see it has a gradual gradient along the graph implying that both variables could be influenced by the variable that we cannot observe.</p>

<pre class="r"><code>credit_worthiness =  cut(credit_worthiness,

<h2>Handling Endogeneity - Instrumental Variables</h2>
<p>Hopefully by now, I have successfully convinced you that 1) endogeneity is a problem, 2) it is common, and 3) it is often well hidden. Borrowing my undergraduate adviser’s words, for a scientist looking to study the world through data plagued by endogeneity, it is [akin to] trying to see your reflection in rippling water. The image you see is distorted by the waves.</p>
<p>In our case, when measuring how interest rates affect default probability, the <em>waves</em> of credit_worthiness affect our perception. So what do we do? We design a special kind of mirror.</p>
<div id="identifying-instrumental-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Identifying Instrumental Variables</h3>
<p>We find a variable that does the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>directly influences interest rates (Relevance)</p></li>
<li><p>only effects default probability through its effect on interest rates (Exclusion restriction)</p></li>
<li><p>is independent of underlying credit worthiness (Exogeneity)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The biggest challenge is identifying the variable that achieves those conditions. My idea was to create a <strong><em>regulatory zone</em></strong> instrument. In real life, <em>regulatory_zones</em> create different regions having slightly different banking regulations that affect interest rates. These regulations don’t directly influence whether a person will default, nor are they related to the person’s underlying credit worthiness.</p>
<p>In lieu of actual data, I’ll add a <em>regulatory_zone</em> variable to our baseline simulation, simulating a regulatory change that affects <em>interest_rate</em> but not <em>default_probability</em> directly. We’ll also ensure that it is independent of <em>credit_worthiness</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>simulate_credit_data_with_instrument &lt;- function(n = 1000) {
  data &lt;- simulate_credit_data(n) # base simulation
  
  data$regulatory_zone &lt;- sample(c(0.05, 0.07, 0.1), n, replace = TRUE) # our instrument
  
  # mod interest_rate behavior so that it is affected by regulatory zones
  data$interest_rate &lt;- data$interest_rate + 
                        data$regulatory_zone * 0.1 +  # regulatory effect

<div id="utilizing-instrument-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Utilizing Instrument Variables</h3>
<p>Once the instrument variables are <em>found</em>, the methodology, as we covered in the previous post, is just a two-stage least squares.</p>
<p>First stage: we regress the endogenous variable (<em>interest_rates</em>) on our instrument (<em>regulatory_zone</em>) and other controls.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>first_stage &lt;- lm(interest_rate ~ regulatory_zone + business_age + annual_revenue + 
                                  current_debt + credit_utilization + cash_flow_volatility,
                  data = credit_data_iv)</code></pre>
<p>Second stage: use these predicted interest rates to estimate their effect on default probability.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># ivreg() fn uses the AER package to perform a 2-Stage Least Squares method
iv_model &lt;- ivreg(default_prob ~ business_age + annual_revenue + current_debt + 
                                 interest_rate + credit_utilization + cash_flow_volatility | 
                                 business_age + annual_revenue + current_debt + regulatory_zone + 
                                 credit_utilization + cash_flow_volatility,

</div>
</div>
<div id="what-did-iv-achieve" class="section level2">
<h2>What did IV achieve?</h2>
<p>So what was all that? Let’s take it back to the basics. We initially identified a variable, <em>interest_rate</em>, which seemed like a promising explanatory variable but turned out to be highly endogeneious with our target. So we found a new variable, called an instrument, <em>regulatory_zone</em>, that is correlated with <em>interest_rate</em> but not the error term. This instrument helps to isolate the part of the explanatory variable that is not correlated with the error term. In essence, it allows for more accurate estimation of the relationship between the explanatory variable (<em>interest_rate</em>) and the dependent variable (<em>default_prob</em>).</p>
<p>In order to do so, we used a two-stage least squares (2SLS) technique. In the first stage, <em>interest_rate</em> (our problematic variable) is regressed on <em>regulatory_zone</em> (instrument) along with other exogenous variables. This creates a new version of the <em>interest_rate</em> which is now effectively devoid of its correlation with the error term. Then, the original regression is estimated (with <em>default_prob</em> as the dependent variable), but this time using the predicted values from the first stage regression in place of the original <em>interest_rate</em>.</p>
<p>Now that we did all that, we can see how things have shifted:</p>

<p>The above coefficient comparison plot reveals an obvious and quite striking difference in the effect of <em>interest_rate</em> between the naive and IV models. While the naive model shows a moderate positive relationship, the IV model estimates a much larger effect with wider confidence intervals. This difference suggests that the naive model significantly underestimated the true impact of <em>interest_rate</em> on <em>default_prob</em>.</p>
<p>Going back to the simulation code</p>
<pre class="r"><code>default_prob = plogis(-2 - 1.2 * credit_worthiness +  
                           0.3 * cash_flow_volatility + 
                           0.2 * credit_utilization +

<p>In the updated scatter plot above, we can find an even more compelling effect. The naive model (represented by the blue dashed line) suggests a strong linear relationship between interest rates and default probability. However, as we’ve discussed before, looking at the gradient point colors that represent credit worthiness, we can see this relationship is largely driven by the underlying credit worithness. The IV model (represented by the red solid line) corrects for this endogeneity, showing a more modest slope that likely better represents the true causal relationship between interest rates and default probability.</p>

<p>Finally, you can observe that the r-squared value of the naive model,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(naive_model)$r.squared</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.479535</code></pre>
<p>is greater than the r-squared value observed in the IV model,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(iv_model)$r.squared</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.1420803</code></pre>
<p>The decrease in r-squared actually strengthens the validity of the IV model. The naive model’s higher r-squared was artificially inflated by capturing the effect of the unobserved credit worthiness. The IV model’s lower r-squared reflects that it’s isolating just hte causal effect of <em>interest_rate</em>, removing the confounding influence of credit worthiness. The IV model resulted in the intended effect of <strong>more accurate measure of the true effect of interest_rate</strong>.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips</h2>
<div id="when-implementing-consider" class="section level3">
<h3>When implementing, consider…</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start simple</li>
</ol>
<p>The easiest trap to fall into is hastily implementing a complex set of methods that promise to solve everything. Begin with a single, strong, instrument, and only add complexity as needed. It is more important to validate each step thoroughly.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Test more than once</li>
</ol>
<p>“Testing” here goes beyond checking your instrument strength using first-stage F-statistics. Chances are, you are not a domain expert. Validate exclusion restriction using whatever domain knowledge is available. Finally, clearly explain the IV approach to stakeholders and make sure that there is an institutional-level (or at least team-level) buy-in.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Build robustly</li>
</ol>
<p>Data intake (data pipelines) is typically the most vulnerable and fragile area. It is also the area that tends to be blindly trusted, this should not be the case. Make sure to handle missing instrument data, create more than one fallback options, and document every assumption check.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Monitor</li>
</ol>
<p>Good intuition will never be as powerful as carefully designed monitoring. Track instrument strength over time, building especially guarded against how relationships between variables can change.</p>
<p>In my case, I designed monitoring dashboards and automated alerts that would alert the engineer in charge if the relationship between instruments and interest rates started to behave unexpectedly.</p>

<div id="a-challenge-for-you" class="section level3">
<h3>A challenge for you</h3>
<p>Now that we have covered both the problem and the solution, it’s time that you challenged yourself. Review the models that you or your team is responsible for designing and/or maintaining. Are there any concerns for endogeneity? What are some promising instruments in your domain? Remember to start small, and work towards building a system that can handle comprehensive monitoring for all of your models.
Solving endogeneity isn’t simply about building better models. It is about making better decisions that affect real businesses and people.</p>
